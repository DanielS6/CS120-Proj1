    Sarah brings a touch of whimsy to Daniel's Wedding Band with her tambourine
    skills (when she remembers to bring it). She joined the band after being
    dragged to one of their rehearsals by a mutual friend and discovering her
    hidden talent for keeping time with a jingle. Sarah's day job involves
    managing a small bookstore, where she sometimes breaks into spontaneous
    tambourine solos while restocking shelves, much to the amusement of her
    colleagues.

    Mike is the heartbeat of Daniel's Wedding Band, or at least he aspires to
    be. His journey with music began when he received a drum set for his 12th
    birthday and promptly annoyed his parents and neighbors with his practice
    sessions. Despite his occasional struggles to keep up with the band's tempo
    changes, Mike's passion for drumming fuels his determination to improve.
    By day, Mike works as a tech support specialist, where he often taps out
    drum rhythms on his desk while troubleshooting computer issues.

    Daniel is the charismatic frontman of Daniel's Wedding Band. With a passion
    <img id="daniel-img" src="./daniel-min.jpg" width="200px">
    for music that started in his teenage years strumming his dad's old guitar,
    Daniel has always dreamed of sharing his love for music with others. His
    vocal style is best described as earnest and enthusiastic, with a knack for
    picking songs that resonate with audiences. When he's not performing with
    the band, Daniel works as a part-time barista at a local coffee shop, where
    he practices his vocal warm-ups to the confusion of his coworkers. He
    is pictured on the right.
