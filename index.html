<h1>About Us: Daniel's Wedding Band</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to Daniel's Wedding Band, where affordable music meets... well,
    music! We may not be the most polished group of musicians out there, but we
    bring heart and enthusiasm to every performance.
</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>

<p>
    Daniel's Wedding Band was founded on the belief that every couple deserves
    to have live music at their special day, regardless of budget constraints
    or musical perfectionism. We started off as a group of friends who just
    loved jamming together in Daniel's garage. Our passion for music outweighs
    our skill level, but we promise to bring the joy of live music to your
    wedding at a fraction of the cost you'd expect. We are based in Seattle,
    Washington.
</p>

<h2>What We Offer</h2>

<p>
    Our repertoire spans classic hits, from "Sweet Caroline" to "Don't Stop
    Believin'", guaranteed to get your guests singing along (whether they want
    to or not). Our band consists of Daniel on vocals and occasional guitar,
    Sarah on the tambourine (when she remembers to bring it), and Mike, our
    aspiring drummer.
</p>

<h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>

<ul>

<li>
    Affordability: We understand weddings can be expensive, so we offer our
    musical services at rates that won't break the bank.
</li>

<li>
    Passion: While we may not be virtuosos, we are passionate about what we do
    and love bringing live music to life's celebrations.
</li>

<li>
    Personal Touch: When you hire Daniel's Wedding Band, you're not just
    getting a band; you're getting a group of friends who are genuinely excited
    to be part of your special day.
</li>
</ul>
